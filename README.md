# Adaptive Traffic Signal Control System

This project implements an **Adaptive Traffic Signal Control System** designed to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion in urban areas. The system enables users to upload traffic footage, analyze it, and make informed decisions to adapt traffic signal timings dynamically.

## Features

- **Video Upload Functionality:** Users can upload up to 4 traffic videos for analysis.
- **Drag & Drop Support:** Simplifies the process of uploading files.
- **Video Previews:** Uploaded videos are displayed with an interactive preview.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for different screen sizes and devices.
- **Background Image:** Visually enhanced with a dynamic cityscape background.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML5 for structure.
  - CSS3 for styling (including flexbox and responsive design).
  - JavaScript for interactivity (drag-and-drop and video previews).

- **Backend (Optional for Future Enhancements):**
  - A backend system (e.g., Node.js, Python Flask/Django) to handle video uploads and traffic analysis.
 
- Future Enhancements
Traffic Analysis Algorithm:

Implement AI/ML models to analyze uploaded videos and adapt traffic signals dynamically.
Backend Integration:

Store uploaded videos and retrieve processed results.
Data Visualization:

Display analysis results in graphical formats (charts, heatmaps, etc.).
Real-Time Monitoring:

Enable live video feed and real-time traffic signal adjustments.
